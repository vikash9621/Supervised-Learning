        "\n",
        "->Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (response) by fitting a straight line through the data.\n",
        "Its purpose is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable and to understand how changes in the independent variable affect the dependent variable.\n",

        "\n",
        "The key assumptions of SLR are:\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Linearity: The relationship between X and Y is linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Homoscedasticity: The variance of errors is constant across all levels of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Normality: Residuals (errors) are normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> No Multicollinearity: (Applies when there are multiple predictors) – predictors should not be highly correlated.\n",

        "\n",
        "->The method of least squares is a mathematical approach used to find the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.\n",

        "->Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a categorical outcome (usually binary: 0 or 1). It uses the sigmoid (logistic) function to map predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1.\n",
